# Fallout-TTW
Random stuff, settings, mod scripts etc. for my latest Fallout TTW play-through [Fallout, F3, FNV, TTW].

## Licensing

Due to the fact that this repo contains my own work as well as work from other authors, I have decided to separate the licensing for each top-level directory. This is to ensure that the original authors of the mods/scripts etc. are credited and that their work is not used in a way that they did not intend.

My own work is licensed under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/), which is a public domain license. This means that you can do whatever you want with my work, without needing to credit me, but feel free to do so if you want.

## Auto Item Collector

All props to the original author [ebizoe](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/627838) of the [Auto Item Collector](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77775) mod, I just made a few changes to suit my needs.

I initially added all v2.8 files except the esp itself from which only the GECK scripts were extracted. All modifications done afterwards are either my own or merges from a more recent version of the original mod.

My current ini files can be found in the subfolder [config/my_config](./Auto%20Item%20Collector/config/my_config/).
