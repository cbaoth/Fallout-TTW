"This Work" refers to all files included in this package.

"Your Derivative" refers to a copy or derivative of This Work.

You are free to distribute Your Derivative as long as:

1) It's publicly available. This means Your Derivative can only be
hosted where everyone can download it without any sort of payment
or forced agreement such as a registration or required checkbox.

2) It includes this license. This means this License.txt file is
included in Your Derivate and therefore propagates the same terms.
